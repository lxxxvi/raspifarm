  <h3>{% icon fa-rocket %} What's this?</h3>
  <p>
    This is a project conducted by two students of the <a href="http://www.fhnw.ch/">University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland</a>. The website contains instructions and ways how to build a cluster with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> computers.<br />
    Also, it shows how you can install and run exmples for Machine Learning applications using several well-known ML libraries.
  </p>

  <h3>{% icon fa-plug %} Buy the hardware</h3>
  <p>
    If you want to build a cluster on your own, but you do not know what components to buy, you can check out <a href="/hardware.html">our order list</a> and use this as a foundation for your endeavour.<br />
    <br />
    Be informed, that this documentation goes very much along with the <a href="https://github.com/lxxxvi/raspifarm">raspifarm GitHub repository</a>. On this repository you will find many scripts and/or tools that some pages here reference or will make use of.
  </p>

  <h3>{% icon fa-gears %} Installing and configuring the cluster</h3>
  <p>
    If you have 2 or more Raspberry Pi computers and want to make a cluster out of it, but you don't know where to start? We have written down in detail how we did the installation and configuration for our cluster. Feel free to get some inspiration from <a href="/setup.html">the setup manual</a> we elaborated. 
  </p>

  <h3>{% icon fa-magic %} Install and run Machine Learning applications</h3>
  <p>
    Distributed computation is fun. Learn how to prepare your cluster for it and use few Machine Learning frameworks for your experiments.
